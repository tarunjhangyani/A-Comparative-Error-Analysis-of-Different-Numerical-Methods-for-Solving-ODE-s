# A-Comparative-Error-Analysis-of-Different-Numerical-Methods-for-Solving-ODE-s
This project is about testing different numerical methods/techniques of solving ordinary differential equations. Compare the methods for different types of functions, compare the results as well as Error.
As an additional endeavour, the system of body freely falling under gravity in presence of drag. The different numerical methods are testing using experimental initial conditions and numerical as well as experimental results are compared.
