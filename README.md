# A-Comparative-Error-Analysis-of-Different-Numerical-Methods-for-Solving-ODE-s
The goal of the study is to evaluate several numerical approaches/techniques for solving ordinary differential equations, compare the results and Error while using the methods for various functions.
The system of a body falling under gravity freely while experiencing drag is an added effort. The various numerical techniques are put to the test with experimental initial conditions, and the outcomes of the experiments and the numerical tests are contrasted.
